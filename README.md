# OnlineTradingBootstrap
## Goals 
To get a good overview of the site, also we try to bring the topics we show on our site as good as possible
## Description
////////////
### Static part
The static part of our website shows the topics we have chosen for online trading and a few pictures we have chosen for it. Also, the site is kept very simple so that any age group can use it.

### Dynamic part
- The main website is in html and the design in CSS. ///////////////////////////////////

## Risks
The main risk is when someone is for a longer time not in school and only one person is able to continue the work, because both of us have important roles for the team, but there are many other small problems for example when we set our goal to high for our level. 

## Main tasks
The design of our website will be our first main task because we want to make it as modern as possible. ////////////////////
