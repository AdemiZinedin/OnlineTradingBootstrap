# OnlineTradingBootstrap
## Goals 
To get a good overview of the site, also we try to bring the topics we show on our site as good as possible
## Description
Our website online trading will consist of several currencies these will include crypto, stocks and NFTS. We will create this site so that you have live access to all the current values of the currencies. The security and strategies of online trading will also be displayed and presented on our site.

### Static part
The static part of our website shows the topics we have chosen for online trading and a few pictures we have chosen for it. Also, the site is kept very simple so that any age group can use it.

### Dynamic part
- The main website is in html and the design in CSS. Displaying the current crypto or stock values. We also wanted to display them live via API or other tools.

## Risks
The main risk is when someone is for a longer time not in school and only one person is able to continue the work, because both of us have important roles for the team, but there are many other small problems for example when we set our goal to high for our level. 

## Main tasks
The design of our website will be our first main task because we want to make it as modern as possible. One of the biggest tasks of ours was to display the current crypto or stock values. We also wanted to display them live via API or other tools.
